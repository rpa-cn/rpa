## RPA  是什么?




RPA is an application of technology aimed at automating business processes. Using RPA tools, a company can configure software, or a “robot,” to capture and interpret applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses and communicating with other digital systems, according to the Institute for Robotic Process Automation and Artificial Intelligence.

Inclusion of the term "automation" may cause some to confuse RPA with ML and AI. RPA can include ML or AI, but it is governed by set business logic and structured inputs, and its rules don't deviate, whereas ML and AI technologies can be trained to make judgments about unstructured inputs.

RPA scenarios span a wide spectrum, ranging from something as simple as generating an automatic response to an email to deploying thousands of bots, each programmed to complete a specific task, to automate jobs in an ERP system. Insurers use RPA to pipe policy management data into a claims processing application, rather than having humans type them in from their computers.

Enterprises are looking to RPA to automate legacy business processes because their talent, technology and time resources are constrained, Dave Kuder, a principal with Deloitte Consulting LLP, tells CIO.com. With RPA, CIOs can complete in days or weeks manual processes that previously took months or years, and at a fraction of the cost. "You can imagine why this is gaining a ton of traction right now," Kuder says.

The RPA market is small but growing. Spending on RPA software will reach $1 billion by 2020, Gartner says, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 41 percent from 2015 through 2020. By that time, 40 percent of large enterprises will have adopted an RPA software tool, up from less than 10 percent today. For many organizations, RPA may prove to be a stop-gap on their way to AI.

More CIOs are turning to an emerging technology practice called robotic process automation (RPA) to streamline enterprise operations and reduce costs. With RPA, businesses can automate mundane rules-based business processes, enabling business users to devote more time to higher-value tasks. Others see RPA fitting into a larger context, as they take a more deliberate path to adoption, seeking to understand RPA's potential to work alongside machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) tools.

Here CIO.com takes a look at what robotic process automation really is, and how CIOs can make the most of RPA in alignment with business goals.


## RPA 的用途

Robotic process automation (RPA) is the application of technology that allows employees in a company to configure computer software or a “robot” to capture and interpret existing applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses and communicating with other digital systems.Feb 22, 2017

A lot has been written about Robotic Process Automation (RPA) and organizations are starting to understand what it is, what value it can deliver and to some extent also how to apply it in their organizations.

Robotic process automation (RPA) is the application of technology that allows employees in a company to configure computer software or a “robot” to capture and interpret existing applications for processing a transaction, manipulating data, triggering responses and communicating with other digital systems.

Any company that uses labor on a large scale for general knowledge process work, where people are performing high-volume, rules driven, highly transactional process functions, will boost their capabilities and save money and time with robotic process automation software.

Just as industrial robots are remaking the manufacturing industry by creating higher production rates and improved quality, RPA “software robots” are revolutionizing the way we think about and administer business processes, IT support processes, workflow processes, remote infrastructure and back-office work. RPA provides dramatic improvements in accuracy and cycle time and increased productivity in transaction processing while it elevates the nature of work by removing people from dull, repetitive tasks.

“Non-Invasively” means without changing the underlying technology to achieve the automation. Process gurus and industry experts won’t deny the fact that automation exists for ages. Cost Savings, Efficiency gain and productivity are all part of the automation for decades.

So, what’s different in Robotic Automation?

Yes, automation exists for ages but what RPA touches - is the most important aspect of any organization – the Human Capital. Technology has advanced to a point where it has become a reality to build a “digital workforce” and replace (replace might be the wrong term) human workforce. I would rather use “augment” human capabilities. It is an interesting option in various scenarios where organizations have yet to replace or assist manual workers. The potential impact on reducing costs and speeding up various manual tasks, therefore, is high.

Most organizations have a vast amount of tasks that are not fully automated for a multitude of reasons. RPA offers potential ways to automate all or stages of manual rule-based process and consistently apply rules in which human makes potential errors or apply inconsistent rules. Or it guides human personnel from one step to another through intelligent decision. This will free up the most valuable capital of the organization and allow to deploy them to “more value added” activities.

Robotic process automation (RPA) is not "the" answer to all of an organization's automation problems, but it is an interesting option in various scenarios where organizations have yet to replace or assist manual workers. The potential impact on reducing costs and speeding up various manual tasks, therefore, is high. Most organizations have a vast amount of tasks that are not fully automated for a multitude of reasons.

Fundamentally an RPA operates by either recording or mapping a task for the software "robot" to follow computer pathways between screens and various data repositories. RPA tools mimic the same "manual" path taken through applications by a human using a combination of user interface (UI) interaction or descriptor technologies.

How RPA is different than BPM

I have recently seen increased attention on organization enhancing their existing BPM (workflow and rules) systems and investments with robotics. For example, integrating robotics into their existing technology and systems to help automate routine desktop work of Customer Service Reps (CSRs) and others.

BPM systems and robotics systems affect two different, but complementary, business problems. Robotics can be brawn of your operations, BPM is the brains. BPM covers both workflow and business rules; it’s an approach leveraging software and services to provide total visibility into your organization. This includes discovering, documenting, automating, and continuously improving business processes to increase efficiency and reduce costs.

The most value for an organization, however, occurs when Robotics and BPM work together within a company’s architecture. A very simple use case from one of banking customer -

Digitizing account opening process with a robot enables the BPM system to process work without the sluggish limitation of human data entry. And integrating robotics into the BPM equation has another “intended” consequence... a new source of valuable data (We will touch base with this aspect in near future about operational data and behavioral data).

Some Use Cases of RPA -

RPA can be considered in situations in which organizations have found that other integration or automation options are perhaps too expensive or too time-consuming (taking months or years). RPA should be considered both in light of other technical options and with some process change management skills. Use cases for RPA include instances when an organization wants to work with structured data to:
Automate an existing manual task or process with minimal process re-engineering.
Reduce or remove head count from batch data input and output tasks or data re keying.
Link to external systems that cannot be connected to through other IT options.
Avoid major system integration projects or specific new major application deployments.
Replace individual "shadow or citizen IT" desktop automation with enterprise wide automation
Key questions you need to answer before considering Robotic Process Automation

    How efficient are your processes?

Have you investigated where and why rekeying or collating of data exists? What options are there to automate this activity? Whose time are you paying to save by having people re-key data?
Can you or by when will you have redesigned the process to get someone else to type in some or all of the data, such as the customer, supplier or the employee?
Do your processes have sufficient volume to justify robotic process automation?
Do your processes have the opportunity to run 24/7 or are they limited to office hours, and how does that affect your potential deployment?
Is the data in a structured format, or do you need to convert it to a structured format through other tools?
How much short-term process redesign can you do to simply eliminate rekeying or manual tasks?
Do you have a detailed process flow of the end-to-end activities?
Do you have highly paid knowledge workers spending a lot of time collating data from multiple sources and doing data analysis in Excel that could be automated?
2) How effective are your processes?

If you focused on the end-to-end outcome, for example, improving working capital by lowering freight charges, would your focus change to a project about how freight carriers are selected and procurement policies adhered to, which could potentially save much more than initially focusing on further lowering the cost of administrating freight charges? Answering this question will dictate where you should put your focus for coordinating end-to-end processes
If your goal is to renovate the core applications and deploy bimodal solutions integrating legacy systems with digital technologies, would RPA be a faster, perhaps short-term option to achieve this type of goal? How will removing labor with RPA affect your ability to build business cases for future legacy replacement?
Is your organization full of shadow/gray IT projects that while they might be effective also be in need of coordination to support master data initiatives and the single view of a customer?
Some Key takeaways - RPA can be used for manual rule-based process and consistently apply rules in which human makes potential errors or apply inconsistent rules around structured data, RPA applies automation “Non-Invasively”, BPM systems and robotics systems affect two different, but complementary, business problems.

What’s next beyond RPA? Maybe you’ve seen some discussion online about automation and artificial intelligence (AI) – what’s the difference and how to use them. What’s the deal with AI and Machine Learning right on the heels of RPA? There are some confusion on RPA with AI and Machine Learning and terms are used interchangeably. In my next one, I will talk about that and some of the use cases where AI and Machine Learning can be applied to process automation.

## RPA 的意义何在

Robotic process automation (RPA) is the use of software with artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning capabilities to handle high-volume, repeatable tasks that previously required humans to perform.


RPA technology, sometimes called a software robot or bot, mimics a human worker, logging into applications, entering data, calculating and completing tasks, and logging out.

RPA software isn't part of an organization's IT infrastructure. Instead, it sits on top of it, enabling a company to implement the technology quickly and efficiently -- all without changing the existing infrastructure and systems.

The evolution of RPA
Although the term "robotic process automation" can be traced to the early 2000s, it had been developing for a number of years previously.

RPA evolved from three key technologies: screen scraping, workflow automation and artificial intelligence.

Screen scraping is the process of collecting screen display data from a legacy application so that the data can be displayed by a more modern user interface. The advantages of workflow automation software, which eliminates the need for manual data entry and increases order fulfillment rates, include increased speed, efficiency and accuracy. Lastly, artificial intelligence involves the ability of computer systems to perform tasks that normally require human intervention and intelligence.

Benefits of RPA
Robotic process automation technology can help organizations on their digital transformation journeys by:

Enabling better customer service
Ensuring business operations and processes comply with regulations and standards
Allowing processes to be completed much more rapidly
Providing improved efficiency by digitizing and auditing process data
Creating cost savings for manual and repetitive tasks
Enabling employees to be more productive
Applications of RPA
Some of the top applications of RPA include:

Customer service: RPA can help companies offer better customer service by automating contact center tasks, including verifying e-signatures, uploading scanned documents and verifying information for automatic approvals or rejections.
Accounting: Organizations can use RPA for general accounting, operational accounting, transactional reporting and budgeting.
Financial services: Companies in the financial services industry can use RPA for foreign exchange payments, automating account openings and closings, managing audit requests and processing insurance claims.
Healthcare: Medical organizations can use RPA for handling patient records, claims, customer support, account management, billing, reporting and analytics.
Human resources: RPA can automate HR tasks, including onboarding and offboarding, updating employee information and timesheet submission processes.
Supply chain management: RPA can be used for procurement, automating order processing and payments, monitoring inventory levels and tracking shipments.
Differences between RPA and regular automation
What distinguishes RPA from traditional IT automation is the ability of the RPA software to be aware and adapt to changing circumstances, exceptions and new situations. Once RPA software has been trained to capture and interpret the actions of specific processes in existing software applications, it can then manipulate data, trigger responses, initiate new actions and communicate with other systems autonomously.

RPA software is particularly useful for organizations that have many different and complicated systems that need to interact together fluidly.

For instance, if an electronic form from a human resource system is missing a zip code, traditional automation software would flag the form as having an exception and an employee would handle the exception by looking up the correct zip code and entering it on the form. Once the form is complete, the employee might send it on to payroll so the information can be entered into the organization's payroll system.

With RPA technology, however, software that has the ability to adapt, self-learn and self-correct would handle the exception and interact with the payroll system without human assistance.

What to look for in RPA software
When enterprise leaders look for RPA technologies, they should consider a number of things, including:

Scalability: Organizations shouldn't select RPA software that requires them to deploy software robots to desktops or virtualized environments. They should look for RPA platforms that can be centrally managed and scale massively.
Speed: Enterprises should be able to design and test new robotic processes in a few hours or less, as well as optimize the bots to work quickly.
Reliability: As companies launch robots to automate hundreds or even thousands of tasks, they should look for tools with built-in monitoring and analytics that enable them to monitor the health of their systems.
Simplicity: Organizations should look for products that are simple enough that any employee in the business can build and use them to handle various kinds of work, including collecting data and turning content into information that enables leaders to make the best business decisions.
Intelligence: The best RPA tools can support simple task-based activities, read and write to any data source, and take advantage of more advanced learning to further improve automation.
Enterprise-class: Companies should look for tools that are built from the ground up for enterprise-grade scalability, reliability and manageability.
C-level decision-making around RPA
Though automation software is expected to replace up to 140 million full-time employees worldwide by 2025, many high-quality jobs will be created for those who maintain and improve RPA software.

When software robots do replace people in the enterprise, C-level executives need to be responsible for ensuring that business outcomes are achieved and new governance policies are met.

Robotic process automation technology also requires that the CTO/CIO take more of a leadership role and assume accountability for the business outcomes and the risks of deploying RPA tools.

Additionally, the COO, CIO and chief human resources officer, as well as the relevant C-level executive who owns the process being automated, should all work toward ensuring the availability of an enterprise-grade, secure platform for controlling and operating bots across systems.

Where the robotic process automation market is heading
A Global Market Insights Inc. report expects the RPA market to reach $5 billion by 2024. The increased adoption of RPA technologies by organizations to enhance their capabilities and performance and boost cost savings will reportedly drive the growth of the robotic process automation market most during that time.
